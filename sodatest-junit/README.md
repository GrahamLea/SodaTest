This module contains the [JUnitSodaTestLauncherTestBase](https://github.com/GrahamLea/SodaTest/blob/master/sodatest-junit/src/main/scala/org/sodatest/junit/JUnitSodaTestLauncherTestBase.scala)
class which you can create subclasses of in your own test tree in order to have JUnit run your SodaTests.

This is probably the easiest method to get Maven to execute your SodaTests.

The Scaladoc for [JUnitSodaTestLauncherTestBase](https://github.com/GrahamLea/SodaTest/blob/master/sodatest-junit/src/main/scala/org/sodatest/junit/JUnitSodaTestLauncherTestBase.scala)
explains how to use the class and the different approaches that can be used to split your tests up.
