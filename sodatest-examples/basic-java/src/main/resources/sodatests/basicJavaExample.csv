Note,Welcome to the Basic SodaTest Example!
,This block is an example of a Note.
,The number in [square brackets] above shows the line number from which this Note was sourced.
,"Above, you can see the name of this test, the path of its source file relative to the input root, and whether it passed or failed."

Note,"Below, the Fixture is set from which the subsequent Events and Reports will be created."
,"While most tests will be written using a single Fixture, it's possible to change the Fixture any number of times throughout a test."
,"In the executable blocks - Fixtures, Events and Reports - line numbers are shown in the left-hand column."

Note,The following block is a Report which has no paramters.
,"This is an inline Report, because the execution marker - !! - appears on the same line as the Report name."
,"There is no difference in the Report implementation. It's just shorthand for executing a zero-parameter Report in one line."
,"As we have no Customers at the moment, the expected result of this Report is an empty table, hence why the execution is the only line in the block."

Report,Customers,!!

Note,The following Report block takes one parameter: Account Name.
,"The Report is executed twice, once for an Account Name of 'Graham Lea' and once for 'Spike Spiegel'."
,"If you look at the abstract CustomerReport class that BalanceReport extends, you'll see that Account Name is not simply a String but an instance of the AccountName class."
,SodaTest automatically coerces the string from the table into an AccountName object using the public constructor on AccountName that takes a String.
,The Report is expected to return 'Unknown Account' for both executions.

Note,The following block is an Event block.
,"This invocation of the Event takes four parameters, each of which is coerced in a different fashion before being bound to the Event:"
,"  o 'Account Name', as with the Balance Report above, is coerced to an AccountName object."
,"  o 'Initial Deposit' is coerced to an Option[Money], where the String -> Money coercion is made by discovering the MoneyEditor class, then creating and invoking an instance."
,"  o 'Tags' is coerced to a List[String] by splitting the cell's value at each comma. You can also coerce a comma-separated list into a List of any other type for which a Coercion is available, e.g. a List[Money]"
,"  o Finally, 'Interest Formula' is coerced using a custom instance of Coercion that is disovered through a CoercionRegister instance inside the OpenAccountEvent."

Note,"Here we have another invocation of the inline Report from the top, except this time it returns the name of the new Account."

Note,"Notice in the Report block below that the reflective APIs of SodaTest are not case-sensitive, and also ignore all non-alphanumeric characters."

Note,"In the following Event, the value of 'Initial Deposit', which is bound to an Option[Money], is left as an empty string."
,"This will be coerced to the None value, as will any String that trim()s to the empty string and is bound to an Option."

Note,"It's probably worth noting that Events do not use an execution marker. (!!)"
,"This is simply because Events have no output to match, so every line under the Event name is an execution."

Note,"Finally, here is a Report that expects more complex output than the others above."
,"You can play around with the source of this block to see how SodaTest represents different kinds of Report mismatches."
,You could try:
,o Changing the value in a cell
,o Removing the value in a cell
,o Adding a cell to a line (or removing one)o
,o Adding or removing whole lines
